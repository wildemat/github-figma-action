Automatically processes Figma design links in GitHub PR descriptions, replacing them with organized design specifications and previews.

## Features

- Scans PR descriptions for Figma URLs (above and within the Design Specs section)
- Fetches version info and timestamps from Figma API
- Replaces original Figma URLs with references to organized Design Specs section
- Embeds preview images with 30-day expiration from Figma's temporary URLs
- Organizes all design specs in a dedicated section with collapsible details
- Prevents duplicate entries and maintains proper numbering
- Includes blank description fields for manual editing

## Installation

### Option 1: Reusable Workflow (Recommended)

1. In your repository, create `.github/workflows/figma-pr-images.yml`:

```yaml
name: Figma PR Images

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited]

jobs:
  figma-pr-images:
    uses: wildemat/github-figma-action/.github/workflows/reusable-figma-sync.yml@main
    secrets:
      FIGMA_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FIGMA_TOKEN }}
```

### Option 2: Copy Files

1. Copy the `.github` folder and `package.json` to your repository
2. Add `FIGMA_TOKEN` to your repository secrets

### Option 3: Git Subtree

```bash
git subtree add --prefix=.figma-action https://github.com/wildemat/github-figma-action.git main --squash
```

Then create `.github/workflows/figma-pr-images.yml`:

```yaml
name: Figma PR Images

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited]

jobs:
  figma-pr-images:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pull-requests: write

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: "21"
      - run: cd .figma-action && npm install
      - env:
          FIGMA_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FIGMA_TOKEN }}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          PR_NUMBER: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
          PR_BODY: ${{ github.event.pull_request.body }}
        run: node .figma-action/.github/scripts/figma-pr-images.js
```

## Setup

### 1. Get Figma API Token

Visit **https://www.figma.com/settings** and follow these steps:

1. Go to **Account** tab (if not already selected)
2. Scroll down to **"Personal access tokens"** section
3. Click **"Create new token"**
4. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "GitHub Action")
5. Copy the generated token immediately (you won't be able to see it again)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Save the token right away - Figma only shows it once for security reasons.

### 2. Add GitHub Secret

In your repository, go to **Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions** and add:
- **Name**: `FIGMA_TOKEN`
- **Value**: The token you copied from Figma

### 3. Test the Setup

Create a PR with a Figma URL in the description to verify the action works correctly.

## How It Works

### 1. Adding Figma Links

Paste Figma design URLs anywhere in your PR description. The script processes:
- Links **above** the Design Specs section 
- Links **within** the Design Specs section (in unprotected areas)
- Links **below** the Design Specs section are ignored

### 2. Supported URL Formats

```
https://www.figma.com/design/FILE_ID/FILE_NAME?node-id=NODE_ID
```

Examples:

- Standalone URL: `https://www.figma.com/design/PtEQFlGwta7PzrMwRjqquH/Homepage--9.2?node-id=3143-20344`
- Markdown link: `[New homepage design](https://www.figma.com/design/PtEQFlGwta7PzrMwRjqquH/Homepage--9.2?node-id=3143-20344)`

### 3. Processing Behavior

**Before processing:**

```markdown
Here's the new design: https://www.figma.com/design/PtEQFlGwta7PzrMwRjqquH/Homepage--9.2?node-id=3143-20344

And [another view](https://www.figma.com/design/PtEQFlGwta7PzrMwRjqquH/Homepage--9.2?node-id=3185-7339)
```

**After processing:**

```markdown
Here's the new design: [Refer to Design Spec 1 below](#design-spec-1)

And another view ([Refer to Design Spec 2 below](#design-spec-2))

## Design Specs

<!-- ... similar structure ... -->

<!-- END_SPEC_2 - DO NOT EDIT CONTENT ABOVE -->

<!-- END_DESIGN_SPECS - WILL NOT DETECT FIGMA LINKS BELOW THIS LINE -->
```

## Design Specs Section Requirements

### Section Heading Format

The script looks for "Design Specs" headings in any of these formats (case-insensitive):

```markdown
# Design Specs
## Design Specs  
### design specs
#### DESIGN SPECS
##### Design specs
###### design Specs
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Only **one** Design Specs section is allowed. If multiple sections are detected, the script will error and ask you to consolidate them.

### Hidden End Marker

The script automatically adds a hidden HTML comment to mark the end of the Design Specs section:

```html
<!-- END_DESIGN_SPECS - WILL NOT DETECT FIGMA LINKS BELOW THIS LINE -->
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: If you manually move or edit the Design Specs section, ensure you also move this end marker. The script uses this marker to:

- Determine where to append new design specs
- Count existing design specs for proper numbering
- Avoid processing Figma links that appear below this marker

### Protected Content Areas

Each design spec is surrounded by protected markers:

```html
<!-- START_SPEC_1 - DO NOT EDIT CONTENT BELOW -->
<!-- ... spec content ... -->
<!-- END_SPEC_1 - DO NOT EDIT CONTENT ABOVE -->
```

Content within these markers is never modified by the script, ensuring your generated specs remain intact.

### Link Processing Rules

1. **Processes links above and within Design Specs section** - Links below the section end marker are ignored
2. **All links become references** - Both above and within section links are replaced with reference text pointing to generated specs
3. **Maintains existing numbering** - New specs continue from the highest existing number
4. **Handles both formats**:
   - Standalone URLs ‚Üí `[Refer to Design Spec X below](#design-spec-x)`
   - Markdown links `[text](url)` ‚Üí `text ([Refer to Design Spec X below](#design-spec-x))`
5. **Creates section if missing** - If no Design Specs section exists, creates one at the end
6. **Uses existing version if specified** - If URL contains `version-id` parameter, uses that instead of fetching latest
7. **Includes description field** - Each spec includes a blank **Description:** field for manual editing

### Safe for Issue Templates

You can safely include `## Design Specs` in your GitHub issue templates. The action:
- **Respects section boundaries** - Only processes content within the Design Specs section 
- **Stops at next heading** - Processing ends when it encounters the next section heading of the same level (e.g., another `##` heading)
- **Won't interfere** - Other template sections like "## Steps to Reproduce" or "## Expected Behavior" remain untouched

### Image Expiration

- Figma API image URLs expire after **30 days**
- The expiration date is displayed in each design spec
- After expiration, images will show as broken links but the Figma design links remain functional

## Testing

This project uses Jest for testing with comprehensive coverage of the core functionality.

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Generate JSON coverage summary
npm run test:coverage-json
```

### Continuous Integration

Tests run automatically on every push and pull request via GitHub Actions. The workflow:
- Runs tests on Node.js 21
- Generates coverage reports
- Updates the coverage badge on the main branch
- Enforces minimum 70% coverage thresholds

### Test Coverage

The test suite covers:
- Figma URL parsing and validation
- API response mocking for offline testing
- Design spec snippet generation
- Reference text creation
- Link object creation
- Date calculations and URL formatting

Coverage results are automatically updated and displayed in the badge above. The CI enforces minimum coverage thresholds of 70% for branches, functions, lines, and statements.
